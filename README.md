Coroutines execution via a chainable API.

Still to be defined what this project should be about.

* Main topic of the library should be chaining coroutines in a simple way
* Find good example about when to use coroutines and implement the solution using washington
* How to address error handling? Following a promise-like API?
* Include a set of "common functions" to build a library working with coroutines? Such as `filter`, `pluck`
* How to include **sink** functions like `reduce` that should create a final result
